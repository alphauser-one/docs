## Our Philosophy

We believe that it is one thing to receive guidance and advice, but finding and  implementing a suitable solution is another.

Our system is the culmination of nearly a decade of experience implementing a wide variety of systems and solutions for asset managers, brokers, research analysts and corporate finance advisers.

It is built on architecture, which is customisable and flexible and covers a wide variety of areas.

We combine tools and frameworks as well as advice which ties together the whole range of areas such as compliance to accounting to operations into a holistic system.

We are constantly designing and adding new tools and processes to the system so remember to check back in regularly!

## Tools

Below are a summary of the tools used in our system.

All tools are used within a process.

### Trade Blotter
The trade blotter is used to record all the orders sent to a broker.

It is typically used to implement pre-trade controls such as trade reconciliation and perform other functions like calculate commissions.

Trades are input whenever they are executed and may be sorted and filtered according to their date, clients, asset class etc.

### Holdings Database
This database contains positions and is either input manually or calculated from the trade blotter. It is used to generate risk reports.

Instead of calculating the positions from the trade block, it is also possible to input information from bank statements in order to aggregate positions for clients who have accounts with multiple custodians.

### Client Database
The client database contains information of the client, which will be fed into the trade blotter, used to generate risk reports and perform AML.&#x20;

### Staff Database
The Staff database allows you to keep track of staff information such as CPT, external roles as well as their declarations.

### Partner Database
The partner database contains information about all your Trading counter parties. Information such as commission rebates are included. This is used to estimate commissions generated from trades put into the trade blotter.
